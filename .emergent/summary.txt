The AI engineer's work centered on iteratively refining the EaseMind institutional website on Vercel, driven by detailed user feedback on UI/UX, responsiveness, and internationalization. Key tasks included a comprehensive footer redesign (layout, centralization, translations, element removal) and mobile app UI updates, specifically for the panic button's visual and animation. Significant effort was dedicated to fixing website translation inconsistencies across pages and ensuring content accuracy, including the How it works and Plans sections. A critical debugging phase addressed a non-functional voice/text chat in the mobile app, pinpointing environment variable reading issues. The engineer meticulously updated HTML, CSS, and translation JSONs across the codebase. Challenges involved deployment complexities between the local unified-server and Vercel. The trajectory concludes with the engineer identifying and correcting hardcoded elements on the  page, indicating an ongoing commitment to robust internationalization and UI consistency.

The EaseMind application is a mobile-first emotional support tool for anxiety, featuring an AI chat (Luna persona with OpenAI LLMs), panic button, guided sessions, and a journal, supporting light/dark modes and multi-language with an Apple-like serenity design. The institutional website (easemind.io) features public pages (Landing, How it works, Plans, FAQ, Contact, Legal), multi-language support (PT-BR default, EN, ES), and a Rootd-inspired premium visual redesign including animated gradients, 3D illustrations, and micro-interactions. The website is hosted on Vercel, while the mobile app and backend are on Emergent. Recent user requests have focused on refining the website's footer (layout, centralization, translations, removing specific elements like the Baixar App button and Brazil flag), updating the mobile panic button's visual and animation (breathing effect with an SOS label), ensuring website content translations (e.g., Why choose EaseMind?, Simple, fast, and effective), enhancing the How it works page with detailed explanations and consistent design (including images and text visibility), and correcting the Plans page (duplicate checkmarks, pricing, text centralization, and translation). The mobile app's AI chat voice and text functionality also required debugging due to backend connection issues.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: FastAPI backend. Contains  and  endpoints for AI voice functionalities. Its configuration and accessibility were debugged.
-   ****: Mobile app's main tab navigation layout. Modified to embed the panic button with a new image (), an enhanced breathing animation, and an SOS text label below it.
-   ****: Mobile app's main chat screen. Involved debugging for correctly reading  to establish connection with the backend API for chat functionality.
-   ****: Mobile component for voice input. Debugged to ensure it correctly triggers recording and transcription processes.
-   ****: Frontend environment variables.  was crucial for resolving API connection issues.
-   ****: Expo configuration file. Ensured  was correctly exposed.
-   ** (pt-BR, en, es)**: Website translation files. Extensively updated with new keys and values for:
    *   Footer content (links, disclaimer, copyright, custom phrases).
    *   Website section titles and subtitles (Why choose EaseMind?, How it works).
    *   Detailed explanations for the How it works steps.
    *   Plans page features, pricing disclaimers, and calls to action.
    *   CTAs like Disponible en.
-   ****: New image asset for the mobile panic button.
-   ****: New logo image for the website footer.
-   ****: Express.js server responsible for rendering the website HTML. Received extensive modifications for:
    *   Iterative footer redesign: removed the Baixar App button, centralized disclaimer/copyright, removed the Brazil flag, restructured into 3 and then 4 columns with a new logo.
    *   Integration of all new translation keys for dynamic content rendering across multiple languages.
    *   Complete overhaul of the  route to a detailed, styled page consistent with the home page, incorporating 3D images and enhanced descriptions.
    *   Text visibility adjustments and replacement of TCC with Terapia Cognitivo-Comportamental on the home page.
    *   Update of download buttons on the How it works page to a modern badge style.
    *   Removal of hardcoded âœ“ from plan features and correction of plan pricing across locales.
-   ****: Website's central CSS stylesheet. Updated for:
    *   Styling the redesigned footer (centralization, 3-column, then 4-column layout, responsive adjustments).
    *   Adjusting the How it works subtitle text color to black for better contrast.
    *   Applying styles for the new download button badges, including hover effects.
    *   Centralizing text within pricing cards and removing default checkmark styles on the Plans page.
    *   Extending media queries for comprehensive website responsiveness.
-   ****: Node.js proxy used in the Emergent deployment environment. Its role in proxying requests to the website server (rather than directly serving content) was clarified during local debugging.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that the download buttons on the  page of the website were still appearing in a plain, untranslated style, despite previous efforts to update them to a modern badge style with dynamic translations. The user explicitly stated, conferir, porque gastou creditos mas o botao nao mudou, continua do mesmo jeito que antes de pedir para fazer as correcoes. Upon inspecting , the AI engineer identified that the HTML for these download buttons was indeed hardcoded with static English text (, ) instead of properly utilizing the  and  translation keys that had been previously added to the localization files. The current task involves correcting this hardcoding in  to ensure the buttons dynamically load translated text and are displayed with the intended badge styling.
