The AI engineer primarily focused on two main areas: initially, fixing internationalization and minor UI bugs within the existing EaseMind mobile application. Subsequently, the majority of the effort shifted to developing and deploying a new institutional website for . Extensive attempts were made to host this website alongside the mobile app's web version and backend on Emergent under a single custom domain, utilizing Nginx and a custom Node.js proxy. However, due to Emergent's underlying Google Load Balancer architecture, which bypassed these configurations, a strategic decision was made to deploy the website to Vercel while maintaining the mobile app and backend on Emergent. The recent work has been dedicated to implementing a comprehensive premium visual redesign of the Vercel-hosted website, addressing user feedback on aesthetics, responsive design, and content organization. A critical security task involved cleaning OpenAI keys from Git history to enable GitHub integration. The current work is focused on refining website content and internationalization.

The EaseMind app is a mobile-first emotional support application designed for anxiety, emphasizing a calming user experience, accessibility, and privacy. It incorporates an AI chat with a Luna persona (utilizing OpenAI LLMs, Whisper, and TTS), a panic button, guided exercises (Sessions), and a Journal, all supported by Light/Dark modes and multi-language capabilities (EN, PT-BR, ES). The visual design aspires to Apple-like serenity with a lilac/calm blue palette. The development roadmap included core AI memory, advanced mood/session tracking, and future monetization/analytics. A key feature is the Emotional Audio System, integrating ambient sounds and music. Comprehensive legal disclaimers and an About the App section are also required.

The project expanded to include an institutional website (), intended to run in parallel. This website features standard public pages (Landing, How it works, Plans, FAQ, Contact, Terms, Privacy), multi-language support (PT-BR default, EN, ES), a Rootd-inspired design, SEO, and accessibility. Initially aimed for single-domain deployment on Emergent, platform limitations necessitated hosting the website on Vercel, with the mobile app and backend remaining on Emergent. The website's current development focuses on a premium visual redesign, incorporating animated gradients, 3D illustrations, refined typography, micro-interactions (e.g., hover effects, scroll reveals), and ensuring full responsiveness across devices.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in an iterative process of refining the visual design and content of the institutional website hosted on Vercel. The user had provided highly detailed design specifications, including specific color palettes, typography, layout structures, micro-interactions, and assets, aiming for a premium, Apple-like aesthetic similar to Calm or Rootd.

The most recent set of user requests focused specifically on the website's footer and the Como funciona (How it works) section. The explicit requests were to:
1. Remove the Baixar App (Download App) button from the footer.
2. Centralize the disclaimer text (Aviso Importante) in the footer.
3. Centralize the copyright text and the phrase below it in the footer.
4. Remove the Brazil flag from the last phrase in the footer.
5. Address untranslated parts of the footer that were still in Portuguese.

The AI engineer's immediate action was to begin addressing these footer-related requests by updating the translation JSON files () with new keys and values. The trajectory ends with the engineer starting to update the English () and Spanish () translation files for the footer, indicating that the task of making the footer fully translatable and correctly structured/styled is ongoing.
