The AI engineer systematically developed the EaseMind application, progressing through multiple phases from core functionality to advanced features and essential refinements. Initially, the work focused on foundational UI/UX improvements, internationalization fixes, and a significant overhaul of voice functionalities, migrating from ElevenLabs to OpenAI TTS and debugging STT/TTS playback. A major task involved a visual redesign towards an Apple-like serenity aesthetic and the integration of the Luna AI persona. A complex Focused Conversation Overlay was attempted but later removed due to usability issues. Subsequent phases built out core backend orchestration (memory, risk detection, summaries), then advanced features (mood trends, technique tracking, journal, sessions), and finally monetization/analytics placeholders and a comprehensive emotional audio system. Throughout, the engineer also integrated legal disclaimers, an About App section, and addressed numerous UI/UX bugs, including dark mode logo display, tab bar navigation, and multi-language support for various labels and content.

The EaseMind app is a mobile-first (iOS/Android/PWA) emotional support application for anxiety, focusing on a calming UX, accessibility, and privacy. Key features include an AI chat, panic button, guided exercises (Sessions), and a Journal, supporting Light/Dark modes and multiple languages (EN, PT-BR, ES). The Home screen includes a mood picker, AI chat with crisis detection, and typing effects. The Panic button is a red, pulsating TabBar element. The AI persona Luna is an empathetic, natural-sounding virtual therapist, primarily in Portuguese (PT-BR), using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, Whisper, and TTS (Alloy voice) for chat, STT, and TTS. A visual redesign was implemented for an Apple-like serenity with a lilac/calm blue palette, rounded corners, and subtle shadows. The development was structured in phases:
**Phase 1 (Core):** Basic AI memory (last 3 conversations), risk detection, post-conversation summaries, and dynamic context injection for Luna.
**Phase 2 (Advanced):** Mood trends (7/30 days), tracking of effective techniques, guided session tracking, and a Journal with tags.
**Phase 3 (Monetization, Analytics, Expansion):** Placeholder for RevenueCat integration, backend endpoints for aggregated statistics, an improved SOS protocol, and preparation for Blog/CMS integration.
**Emotional Audio System:** Integrate ambient sounds, therapeutic music, and SFX synchronized with user emotion and Luna's instructions, with controls for volume, looping, fade, ducking, and specific tracks for SOS, sessions, and mood check-ins.
**Legal and Information:** Integration of comprehensive legal disclaimers for Luna's responses and an About the App section with multilingual information, emergency contacts, and privacy details.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported bug concerning the Profile screen. The user observed that the labels for Sobre o EaseMind (About the App), Políticas de Privacidade (Privacy Policy), and Termos de Uso (Terms of Use) were not translating when the app's language was switched from Portuguese to English or Spanish, consistently remaining in Portuguese.

The AI engineer identified that these specific labels in the Profile screen () were hardcoded instead of using the  translation keys. The current action taken was to update  by adding the necessary translation keys and their corresponding strings in English, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish.

The last message in the trajectory explicitly states: Perfeito! Traduções adicionadas. Agora vou atualizar o profile.tsx para usar essas traduções: indicating the immediate next step is to modify the  file to utilize these newly added translation keys.
